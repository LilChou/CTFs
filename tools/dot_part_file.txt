if met a *.part file, it might because you haven't downloaded the entire file yet, some solution:

1. Redownload the file
2. Or use the command (referred)
	> wget -O <pwd>/<wanted_file_name> "link_of_the_file_location"
	eg. wget -O /home/yjchou/Downloads/CTFs/GoogleCTF2018/firmware/firmware.zip "https://storage.googleapis.com/gctf-2018-attachments/9522120f36028c8ab86a37394903b100ce90b81830cee9357113c54fd3fc84bf"

	downloads the file from the location to the firmware directory
		and name it firmware.zip
