In the .c file we saw that the input will be run.

So in order to let the input value become the win function
check the location of the function
> readelf -s guess_num 
 0x804852b

this is going to be right shift 4 bits
so the input should be the addr left shift 4 bits

but we then found the number to overflow
the max int is 2147483647
but the num after shifted is 2152223408 > 2147483647

so we should flip all bits and add one to get the 2 complement num
of the target

thus

python
bin(2152223408).replace('1','t').replace('0','1').replace('t','0')

(result+1) * (-1) = ans = -2142743888
