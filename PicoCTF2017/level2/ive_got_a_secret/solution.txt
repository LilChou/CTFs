since it mentioned format string attack
we might be able to find something on the stack, and the code prints our input without any specification


so in the code, we use %p to see what's on the stack

and we can specify with %5$p to get only the data on the fifth location on the stack

----------------------------------
./connect.sh

> %6$p
> input what we get from the $6$p
