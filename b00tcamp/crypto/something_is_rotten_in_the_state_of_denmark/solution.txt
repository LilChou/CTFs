hint1:	something is rotten in the state of denmark
hint2:	project gutenberg
hint3:	use the txt file


in the code, we found that the counter char is adding, and char is 1 byte, 256bit, so counter repeats every 256 blocks

p1 XOR s1 = c1
.
.
.
p255 XOR s255 = c255
p256 XOR s1 = c256


so use project gutenburg
