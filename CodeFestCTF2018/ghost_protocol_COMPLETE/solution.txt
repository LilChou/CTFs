open 2 terminal and both connect to the server

in the source code we can see that the flag will be given if
the seconde received input is equal to the str(enc.encrypt(val))

and there is another place where we can get a str(enc.encrypt(nounce))

so at the first connection, input name1 nounce1
and received val1 and target1

at the second connection, input name2 target1
and received val2 and str(enc.encrypt(target1))

then return the str(enc.encrypt(target1)) back to the first connection

and the first connection will spit out the flag!
